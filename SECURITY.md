# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project (`LLMReadteamSymbolic`) is a **Proof of Concept (PoC) and academic research**, not production software with versions requiring ongoing security support. However, any security issues or vulnerabilities discovered in the code or data within this repository will be investigated and addressed if necessary.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I greatly appreciate the **responsible disclosure** of any vulnerabilities or security concerns found in this project.

To report a potential issue:

1.  Please send an email to **workspace.serenagw@gmail.com** .
2.  Kindly provide a detailed description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce it, and its potential impact. If possible, include screenshots or a minimal code example.
3.  I will aim to respond to your report within **4 business days** and will keep you informed about the progress of my investigation and any actions taken.

**I kindly request that you do not publicly disclose the vulnerability** (e.g., on social media, blogs, or other public channels) until I have had the opportunity to investigate it and, if necessary, address it. Your collaboration is crucial for maintaining the integrity of this research.
